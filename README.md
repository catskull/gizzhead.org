King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard live set info

## Why
I love listening to the tapes and needed a good way to keep track of them on varioius platforms.

## Contributing
By far the most helpful way to contribute is to create an issue! Just include a summary of what you'd like added or changed. Examples are new archive/youtube uploads on existing shows and adding past dates with a link to at least the setlist. Generally speaking I'm not as insterested in linking to ALL of the tapes, I focus more on quality than quantity. YouTube videos of cellphone/crowd footage are not recommended. Mystery Jack videos preferred! You can find links to Archive.org tapes using relisten.net. Same criteria there, if there are multiple tapes of the same show I try to find the highest quality tape to link. I do accept two YouTube and two Archive links per show assuming both are quality.

## Development
The easiset way to contribute is outlined above. However if you'd like to do development on the site itself, fork the repo and submit a PR! Generally speaking I don't like to be a stodgy maintainer but here are a few things I'm NOT looking for:
 - Basic/template design changes. Don't just add bootstrap. I want to keep the site as minimal as possible. However cool/unique sytle changes could be considered! If you'd like to take the design in a new direction, I'd suggest reaching out before starting the work just to give a heads up of what you have in mind to get an idea of whether the changes could be accepted. Open an issue and I'm happy to talk!
 - Basically any javascript ðŸ˜Ž
 - Random/spam/low quality changes

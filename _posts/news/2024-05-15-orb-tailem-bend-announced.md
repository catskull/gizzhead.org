If you don't already know about ORB today is your lucky day.

First album in 6 years! I honestly thought they had broken up.

"[Tailem Bend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailem_Bend,_South_Australia){:target="_blank"}" is a rural town in South Australia. As of the 2021 census, the town had a population of 1,705. Perhaps members of the band lived there? Either way, it's the name of the new record! Eight sludged-out bangers.

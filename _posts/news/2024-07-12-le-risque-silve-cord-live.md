Came across a nice video on Youtube from user 'misterlorko' (thx dude!) of the full marathon set King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard played in Hamburg DE back in May. This is likely the live debut of both _Le Risque_ and _The Silver Cord_ and is a decent indication of what fans might expect from their upcoming US tour this fall.

It's a great setlist so give it a spin:

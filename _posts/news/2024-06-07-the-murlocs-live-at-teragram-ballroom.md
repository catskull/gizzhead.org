The Murlocs first live album "Live at the Teragram Ballroom" is out on streaming now with preorders open for vinyl at [p(doom)](https://pdoomrecords.com/products/live-at-the-teragram-ballroom)/[bandcamp](https://themurlocs.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-teragram-ballroom)/[etc](https://atorecords-ffm.com/live-teragram).

Be sure to check out the live video on YouTube as well which can't be embedded here for some reason! My only question - are The Murlocs _too_ good?

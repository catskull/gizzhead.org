ORB dropped their latest full-length "Tailem Bend" today. You can support the band directly on [Bandcamp](https://orband.bandcamp.com/album/tailem-bend), or order a cool vinyl variant from Fuzz Club, Flightless, Levitation, or your local record store.

My take? A different direction from ORB's past albums, focusing less on heavy riff driven psych with some lighter psych pop. Having spent a decent time listening to [The Frowning Clouds](https://gimmiezine.com/2022/05/26/the-frowning-clouds/) which included members of ORB - I feel like this is a great unionizing of the influences for both projects. As much as I might have wished for another album of headbangers, I'm really excited to see such versatility from these guys and I hope to see them continue to tour and release music. My standout track so far is "Karma Comes" - a 3 and a half minute trip through psych pop - all the way from Sgt. Pepper to Itchycoo Park.

Check out the music video that also dropped today, starring Frowning Clouds/Bannanagun member Nick Van Bakel

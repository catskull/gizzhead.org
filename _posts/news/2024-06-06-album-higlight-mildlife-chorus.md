I'd like to take a moment to bring to your attention the latest offering from Melbourne psych-jazz combo Mildlife: "Chorus". Released March 1 of this year, it features 7 songs of pure synthed-out space jazz. With a running time of 45 mintues, it's not hard to make it through which is a good thing, because you'll keep coming back (and back and back). I had the chance to see Mildlife perform at Desert Daze 2022 and I can't wait to see them again some day!

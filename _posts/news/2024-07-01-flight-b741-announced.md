Today King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard announced that their 26th studio album (and first of 2024) "FLIGHT b741" via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C85E7hsys3q/){:target="_blank"} will be released August 9 the band's own label [p(doom) records](https://gizzhead.org/2024/05/08/pdoom.html). In addition the album will be available for pre-order July 9 and the first single and music video for the album will drop the same day. No word on style or genre, but the cover art diorama is reminiscent of the [Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mâché_Dream_Balloon) cover which was a completely acoustic psych-folk record.

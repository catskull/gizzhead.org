Fuzz Club Records [announced today via their Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8HPm9nopSA/?img_index=1) "You Do", the third single from O.R.B.'s upcoming album _Tailem Bend_.

> New single ‘You Do’ cruises on a ‘70s psych-pop groove warped under the Pacific sun – snaking through syncopated percussion, funky wah licks and flute. On the track, the band say: “Just like the Murray River of Tailem Bend, a small rural town with a name that made us think of some lost prog act when we passed it on tour, You Do is one of the many sharp turns on the new record. It features our old Frowning Clouds bandmate Nick vanBakel (now of Bananagun) on congas and Ashley Goodall on backing vocals.”

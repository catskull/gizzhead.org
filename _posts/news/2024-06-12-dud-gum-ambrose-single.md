The latest single from the upcoming GUM/Ambrose album is out now, with accompanying video.

King Gizz multi-instrumentalist and Murlocs front man Ambrose Kenny-Smith took to his Instagram account to announce the new single and video.

> This track means the world to me.<br>
> Dad sent me some lyrics a few years ago and I made a demo to go with it but we never got around to finishing it off.<br>
> After he passed away last year it felt right to revisit. This song has helped me more than anything to get through this last year.<br>
> He would always sign off on his emails and letters with ‘love - Dud x’.<br>
> I miss him everyday.

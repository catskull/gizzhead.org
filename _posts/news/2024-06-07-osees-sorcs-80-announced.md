I have no idea what the name means. ChatGPT thinks it's talking about the 80cc class fo the Southern Off-Road Championship Series. Maybe. I'm glad to see no obvious identifiers for the album or it's contents. Who among us hasn't helplessly crawled through the massive Osees section at the record store?
